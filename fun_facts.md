1. My favorite fruit is jackfruit.
2. I like to collect candles- I like candles that smell earthy and warm as opposed to something more sharp and fruity. I also prefer candles that have a darker design on the glass container or wax.
3. A dream trinket I want for my room is really any clock from tmclocks on Instagram. The clocks they have are timeless, elegant, and beautiful with intricate design, dynamic movement, and gentle music.
