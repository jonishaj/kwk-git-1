<h1> About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jonisha! I'm 20 and I am studying Physics. 
    I am interested clocks that make music and have moving parts. 
    I also read books that analyze social phenomena. 

    I took part in KWK's Web Development camp when right before my 
    senior year of high school. That was my first in-depth experience
    with HTML and CSS. Since then, I've worked with MATLAB and a bit of 
    Python. I decided to take part in this program because I wanted experience
    in working with data and visuals.
